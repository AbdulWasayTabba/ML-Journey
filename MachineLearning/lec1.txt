Intro to machine learning

you provide data and and train the model on algorithms 
and then the model will act according to the data

lets say youre making a program to called 
spam classifier but in the programming way you will have
to write 1000+ of if else cases 
so ml is used 

ml is done from pattern

in ml all you have to do is give the right data
not rules
 

so if ml can do everyhting why do we need dl

dl is basically a class of algorithms
you use the same procedures like in ml
its just that the algorithms in dl are a diffrent

dl is inspired by neurons (our biology)

in dl you dont have to worry about the features but 
in ml you have to make the featues in dl 
it extract them 

in dl the more data you gives the better it 
gets

in ml it dosent keep on improving but it stablizes

on large data dl is better, on small data ml


Types of Machine Learning
1: Supervised Learning

You train the model with input and output both (you already know the correct answers).

The model learns to predict the output for new inputs.

Regression: Used when the output is a number (like predicting price, temperature, etc.).
Classification: Used when the output is a category (like “spam or not spam,” “dog or cat”).

2: Unsupervised Learning

You only give input data (no correct answers are given).

The model tries to find patterns or structure in the data on its own.

Clustering: Groups similar data points together (like grouping customers by buying habits).

Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifies data by removing extra or less important features.

Anomaly Detection: Finds unusual data points that don’t fit the pattern (like detecting fraud).

Association: Finds relationships between items (like “people who buy bread also buy butter”).

3: Semi-Supervised Learning

You give the model a few labeled examples and many unlabeled ones.

It learns from both to make better predictions.
(Example: a few pictures labeled “cat” and “dog,” and many pictures without labels.)

4: Reinforcement Learning

The model (called an agent) learns by doing actions and getting rewards or penalties.

Goal: learn which actions give the best reward over time.
(Example: a robot learning to walk or a game bot learning to win a game.)



production is the server on which the code will run
ml softwares are deployed on these server 

batch vs online ml

batch = use all of the data together to train the model
no incremental training 

you train the model on an offline server then test
then you deploy the model which has learned online


the problem is that the model is static 
because when you train it the model wont keep on
learning so in term of time it isnt the best option
because it will become obsolete so you will have to 
retrain it from time to time and in the data 
when retraining it you will have to merge the new data
with the old data and then retrain it 

the limation may come that the data may become 
too large 
another limitation is connectivity 
another one is availability


online learning

usuability will impove the product
this learning is done incrementally 

you start with some data and feed it to the ml algorithm
test it then send it to the server 
on the server you keep on getitng new data so it 
learning from that data to 
you are training the model dynamically
e.g youtube (recommendations)


when to use what ?

1 there is a concept drift
where there are fast changes (stock exchange = online learning)
2 cost effective
3 faster solution

How to implement?
python libraries sckit learn, river etc


Learning Rate

you have to keep a correct learning rate 
so the model dosent misbehave

out of core learning 

the data is so huge that you cannot load it 
in one go in this scenario 
you can use online learning where you convert the 
data into small data sets
however all this input of data is done offline
not online 

Disadvantage

1 tricky to use
2 Risky: (hacker)



how does the machine learnign model learn

instance vs model based learning

learning

1: memorizing
2: generalizing

Instance based 
trainign ya leraning isnt done
you pick data point new point comes and output is
done according to the old data points
(KNN,kernel)

Modle based
they find a methematcal relationship 
between input and output and from that result
you get a descion boundry and using that you 
can classify the incoming point
so you dont require the data points you need 
the boundry which will come from the old data point
but the new points dont require it
in model based you have to find the rule
requires less storage
e.g(linear regress,descion tree)


challenges you will faced in the ml journey

1: Data collection : API, WebScraping

2: insufficient Data/Labelled Data

3: Non Representative Data

4: Poor Quality Data

5: Irrelevant features(garbage in garbage out)(feature engineering)

6: Overfitting

7: Underfitting

8: Software integration

9: offline learnign

10: cost involved



Machine Learning Development Life Cycle(MLDLC/MLDC)
 
1: Frame the problem :whole plan 
2: Gathering Data(csv, API, WebScraping) from a Database 
you make a data warehouse and work on that
3: Data Preprocessing: remove duplicates,remove missing values
remove outliers, scale values
4:Exploratory Data Analysis:study the relationship between
input and output so you do visualization(univariate analysis,
bivariate analysis, multivariate analysis),outliers Detection,
handle imbalance dataset
5:Feature engineering and selection : create new column
for lesser memory or makes analysis easier
6:Model Training,Evaluation and Selection: apply diffrent algorithms
and see the results and decide which one too use on the basis
of required metrics
7:model Deployment
8:Testing
9:Optimize:model backup ,data backup,load balancing
,frequenlty retrain duration



Framing  a machine learning problem

1: business problem to ml problem
2:types of problems
3 current solutions
4:getting data
5:metrics to measure
6: online vs batch
7: check assumptions
